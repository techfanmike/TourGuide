Tech Tower, The most famous campus landmark
McCamish Pavilion, One of the best places to watch college basketball
Grant Field, Home of the Georgia Tech Jacket football team
Companile Fountain, A fountain with a giant shaft as its centerpiece
Van Leer Building, A soul crushing torture chamber of hopelessness.  The spirits of once happy youth wander in a zombie like haze searching for long departed and unrecoverable happiness.
